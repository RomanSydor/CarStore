            Crazy and unpretentious or independent and aesthetic?
            For the Audi A7, both are correct.
            Elegant coupe-like design lines combine with the brute force of the V-shaped 'Eight' TFSI.
            Innovative technology is combined with intuitive dynamics.

            Meet: New Audi Q2 on stage.
            The completely new geometry of the design clearly demonstrates the distinctive character,
            which is hidden behind clearly defined lines and expressive faces. At the heart of the car's
            showy self-confidence are its extraordinary capabilities thanks to the powerful TFSI
            and TDI units with an output of 150 to 190 hp. and quattro all-wheel drive (optional).

                A relief diffuser with built-in trapezoidal tailpipes gives a sporty look to the rear.
                On the side, the Audi A4 Limousine sports body lines are extended by wide wings and clear sills.
                A large selection of wheels, partly as an option, is available in sizes from 16 to 19 inches.
                The wide recessed grille of the Singleframe radiator,

                For example, the continuous tape ventilation openings emphasize the width of the car,
                and the chrome lining above them successfully accents.
                The large storage compartment in the center console is very convenient.
                Standard interior lighting includes a reading lamp with touch-adjustable brightness.
                An optional backlight package creates an even more cozy atmosphere in the cabin.
                A feature of the Audi A4 Limousine is our modular line concept.
                Thanks to it, the configuration of the car has become more flexible -
